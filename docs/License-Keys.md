# License Keys
DocOrigin is a licensed product. In order to have full use of the product you require a license. See Distributors.

### Evaluation Spoiler Stripe
The primary usage of DocOrigin is to do document generation. If you have a copy of DocOrigin, but do not have a valid license then the generated documents will all have a rather large "E v a l u a t i o n" stripe across them. Once you have a license, that spoiler is not generated.
